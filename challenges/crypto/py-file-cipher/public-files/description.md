# py-file-cipher

Celebrities Alice and Bob are using a shared cryptographic filemanager based on a python file cipher developed by Bob himself ! Unfortunatly, Bob is absentminded and made a huge mistake on the production version of his filemanager. Luckily Alice is not as scatty as he is and dealt with the problem quite easily.

But who are you ? You're obviously Chuck. You're jealous of not being part of the beta-tester group that's why you want to impress Bob with your skills.
What you're looking for is in Alice folder.

Show Bob that you're the best, download the archive and show him what you're made of ! Or maybe not...

Have fun !
